### The origins of the  idea:  

At the age of 18, I moved to the US in pursuit of my dreams. As a young new face, with a weak knowledge of English and life experience in the city of New York, I had difficulties in finding a good affordable housing and a comparatively well paid job. These life challenges of adulthood made me stronger and led me to learn new skills. When I found my interest in coding, I joined boot-camp classes, where I have been challenged to create a project with full stack features. One of my friends accidentally pitched me an idea of this platform, when he asked about job/housing , immigration and information about New-York based communities.

While I was helping him, I developed the idea of the platform, which should digital guide to people to pursue their needss.
