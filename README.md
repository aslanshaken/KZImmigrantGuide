### Date:
March, 2021 - Present 

### Brief short description: 
This is the center of all Kazakh communities in the USA. It provides a lot of useful and latest resources to people here in the USA, especially to people who just immigrated from Kazakhstan. It can be used from anywhere in the world. It focuses on improving Kazakh culture and helping each other in the USA. It's an online guide that helps people to make the right decisions. Kazakhstan is a young country, and as Kazakh people just started to immigrate from all over the world to the USA, I feel like we need a place where we can find valid resources, meet online with each other and discuss important topics here in the USA. It will be available in English, Kazakh and Russian languages.
