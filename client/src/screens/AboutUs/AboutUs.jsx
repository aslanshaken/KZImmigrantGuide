                    The web source aims to integrate all Kazakh communities in the US. Itâ€™s planned to
                    be a digital toolbox and a source facilitator, where Kazakh Americans and newcomers
                    will get veracious up-to-date information on various topics, including immigration,
                    legalization, housing and lease/rent, job-hunting and offering, cultural gatherings etc.

                    At large, it should grow as a communication medium and resource sharing channel for all
                    Kazakhstanis, who repudiate losing their bundle with homeland and native culture.

            <p className="about-paragraph-idea">
                At the age of 18, I moved to the US in pursuit of my dreams.
                As a young new face, with a weak knowledge of English and life experience in
                the city of New York, I had difficulties in finding a good affordable housing
                and a comparatively well paid job. These life challenges of adulthood made me
                stronger and led me to learn new skills. When I found my interest in coding,
                I joined bootcamp classes, where I have been challenged to create a project
                with full stack features. One of my Kazakh friends accidentally pitched me an
                idea of this platform, when he asked about job/housing , immigration and
                information about New-York based Kazakh communities.
                <br />
                <br />
                While I was helping him, I developed the idea of the platform, which should digital
                guide to Kazakh immigrants to pursue their American dreams.
